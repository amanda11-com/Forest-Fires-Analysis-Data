# Forest-Fires-Analysis-Data
My second Project
## Overviwe 
This project aims to analyse forest fire data to gain insights into the causes and consequences of forest fire.The dataset used for this analysis inculdes variabels such as weather conditions, fire behaviours, and spatial locations.
## Dataset
The variabels used for this analysis inculde the following 
X and Y Coordinate 
Month and day of fire 
FFMC [Fire Fule Moisture Code]
DMC [Duff Moisture Code] 
DC [Drought Code]
ISI [Initial Spread Index]
TEMP[Temperature]
RH[Releative Humidity]
WIND[Wind Speed]
RAIN[Rainfall]
AREA[Area burned by the fire]
## Key Findings 
FFMC, DMC, and DC are important indicators fire risk 
Areas with high fuel loads and certain topogarphic feartures are found to be more are found to be more suscepitbel to forest fire
Temperature, Relative humidity, Wind speed were found to be the predictors of fire risk and behaviours
My analysis showed that cretain rejion and times are prone to forest fire
## Tools Used
Data Analysis: Microsoft Excel, Sql
Data Visualization: Power bi
## Recommendation
Develop and implement eary warining system that can dectect forest fires quicklyand accurently, allowing for rapid response and mitigation 
Manage fuel loads in high risk areas thhrough prescribed burning, thinning, or other methods to reduse te riskontain forest fires of forest fire
Moisture and maintain fire breaks, such as fire roads and fuel breaks, to help contain forestfire and prevent them from spreding
Develop targeted pervention and mitigation startegies for high risk areas and communites taking into account local climate, topography into account local climate,tropography, and conditions.
## Conculusion
This forest fire data analysis provides valuable insights into causes and consequences of forest fire.By analysising weather variabeles, fire behaviour, sptaial patterns, i have identified key factors that contribute to forest fire risk and severity. My findings and remmendations can inform fire prevention and mitigation startegies, helping to protect people' property, and natural resources from the devastating impacts of forest fires
